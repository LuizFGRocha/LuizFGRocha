- Hi, I'm Luiz Fernando.
- I started studying Computer Science at UFMG in the first half of 2022. I'm very excited to learn lots of cool stuff related to problem solving, mathematics and programming.
- At the moment, I'm in an undergraduate reasearch program on the selection of optimal wind farms portfolios, using mainly Python with some libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and SKLearn.
- You can reach me through my email: luizfgrocha04@gmail.com.

- Hi, I'm Luiz Fernando.
- I started studying Computer Science at UFMG in the first half of 2022. I'm very excited to learn lots of cool stuff related to problem solving, mathematics and programming.
- At the moment, I'm learning to program in C++.
<!---
- My interests are not well defined yet, but I hope to figure them out as I learn new stuff.
